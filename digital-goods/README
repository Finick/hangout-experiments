# Digital Goods in a Hangout

This project demonstrates how to use the Google Wallet for Digital
Goods API inside a Hangout App. It is a simple App Engine Python
project that depends on
[hangoutiframer](http://hangoutiframer.appspot.com)
to serve the app within an iframe.

## Required knowledge

1. Basic understanding of Python on App Engine. See the [App Engine
documentation](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstartedpython27/)
for more information.

2. Basic understanding of the Payments API. See the [Google Wallet
documentation](https://developers.google.com/in-app-payments/) for
more information.

## Getting Started

1. Create a new project on appspot.com

2. Update the App Name in app-engine/app.yaml, then deploy the app.  (Refer the to the App Engine documentation on how to deploy.)

3. Verify your app is serving by navigating to, where 'myapp' is the name of yoru appspot project.

    https://myapp.appspot.com/iframer

4. Get your Seller ID and Seller Secret at
https://sandbox.google.com/checkout/customer/gadget/inapp/developersignup.html
and update them in app-engine/sellerinfo.py

5. Create an App in the Google+ APIs console.

6. Turn on "Google+ Hangout APIs" in the Services tab.

7. In the "Hangouts" tab, use the following URL, where 'myapp' is the app you created in steps 1 & 2:

    https://hangoutiframer.appspot.com/forward/v0.4?u=https://myapp.appspot.com/iframer

8. Hit "Save" at the bottom of the page.

9. Click on "Enter a Hangout" to launch the app.  If your app does not start, see the [hangoutiframer documentation](http://hangoutiframer.appspot.com).

10. Click "Ajax Purchase" to begin the purchase flow.

11. It is recommended that you use a [test credit
card](https://developers.google.com/in-app-payments/docs/testing) even
though the app is running in sandbox.

## Moving to Production

To switch to production, you need to change the configuration in your JavaScript to:

<pre><code>
google.load('payments', '1.0', {
  'packages': ['production_config']
});
</code></pre>

You'll also want to handle postbacks. See the [Google Wallet
documentation](https://developers.google.com/in-app-payments/docs/postback)
for more details.
