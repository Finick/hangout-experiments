INSTALLATION

You need to create an application in the Google API Console.

https://code.google.com/apis/console/

You need to turn on both Google+ API and Google+ Hangouts API in the
"Services" tab.

In the "API Access" tab, create an OAuth 2.0 client ID.  You do not
need to set the site or hostname, nor any redirect URIs if you are
only using this application in a Hangout.

Enter the URL to your .xml spec in the Hangouts tab.

Start a hangout, and click "Authorize".
